# Wizard Online (up for change)

A python implementation of the classic card game **Wizard**, playable over a network with friends.

This is a class project developed for CSSE432, recreating Wizard as a multiplayer online experience using Python's `pygame` for the user interface and socket programming for network communication.

## Description

Wizard is a trick-taking card game where players predict how many tricks they will win each round. The game includes special Wizard and Jester cards, adding strategic depth.

This project brings Wizard to life online by allowing multiple players to connect over a local network and play in real time. The game interface is built with `pygame`, and multiplayer functionality is handled using sockets.
